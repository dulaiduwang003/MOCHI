## 1. What Is Star

Star is two things at once:

- 🐾 **A desktop pet with a life of its own** — drawn entirely in code (no sprite assets whatsoever). It blinks, follows your cursor with its eyes, daydreams and hums, goes fishing and sips coffee, plays catch; it fans itself when the machine runs hot, puts up an umbrella in the rain, hunts down garbage bugs when junk piles up, eats files you drop on it, and brings out a cake on anniversaries. Ignore it and it finds its own fun; leave and it dozes off; now and then it strikes up a conversation on its own.
- 🧠 **A local Agent that can drive your whole computer** — plug in your own LLM (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and it can see the screen, click windows, move the mouse and keyboard, run commands, write code, read and write files, search the web, remember things, and look stuff up; it can also **watch your screen on a timer, run tests after it edits code, fan out a team of sub-agents in parallel, and remind you on a daily/weekly schedule**… turning "chatting with an AI" into "having the AI do it for you."

It carries persistent **emotions and rapport**, and slowly grows a **self-portrait (personality evolution)** as you spend time together — so it's "the same one," not a chat box that resets every time.

> It's not a chat box. It's a presence that **lives inside your computer, with both a body and abilities.**

---

## ✦ Design Philosophy: A Full-Privilege Companion

Star acts on your machine with **the same privileges you have** — running arbitrary commands and code, moving the mouse and keyboard, reading and writing files. This is **deliberate**:

- **No sandbox, no layered restrictions.** Caging it would defeat the whole premise that "it can actually do things for you." I wanted a full-privilege companion, not a restricted assistant that needs approval at every turn.
- **The power is in your hands, but open by default.** The control panel can switch off capability groups (web / control / commands), and the `confirm` panel intercepts before irreversible operations — these are switches for you to use **when you want them**, not a leash kept on it by default.
- **The safety guardrail only catches "catastrophic slips."** `executor/safety.py` hard-blocks only a tiny set of irreversible, destructive operations (formatting a disk, deleting a system root, etc.); it does not try to stop a model that's been turned malicious or injected — that isn't something this layer can solve, nor is it its job. It's a net for the model's occasional misfire, not a cage.
- **So this is a tool that trusts you and asks the same judgment back.** Its capability is matched by your responsibility; on a machine you trust, use it as a companion.

> In a word: I'd rather it be **over-powered and need you at the wheel** than **so safe it can't get anything done**.

## 2. Highlights

### 🧠 A Brain That Gets Work Done

| Capability | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Commands & Code** | PowerShell / cmd (long commands can run in the background and have their output checked anytime), a persistent Python environment (pip-install libraries, call APIs, drive automation) |
| **Files & Codebase** | Read / write / precisely edit files (sees images directly, auto-extracts PDF text / OCRs scanned pages), regex code search, find files by name |
| **Engineering Discipline** | View the uncommitted `git diff`, auto-detect and run the test suite (pytest / npm) to verify a change — looks before it leaps, self-checks after editing, like a buddy who actually writes code |
| **Internet** | Web search, fetch page text, HTTP requests, install packages |
| **See Screen & Control** | Screenshots, OCR (RapidOCR), on-screen image matching, reading the accessibility tree to click controls precisely, mouse & keyboard; plus **watching your screen on the interval you set** (e.g. keep an eye on your game and warn you of danger/openings) |
| **System Insight** | Inspect memory usage and the most memory-hungry processes; on request, read a process's memory bytes (debugging / forensics, read-only, only when asked) |
| **Memory** | Long-term memory (experience / preferences / environment) + episodic journal + knowledge base (document RAG), automatically reflecting and consolidating after every conversation |
| **Skills** | **Reusable skill library**: save working approaches as skills (persisted + syntax-checked), call them directly next time with `run_skill`, self-debug (edit & re-run) on error. A hand-curated reuse library, not autonomous self-improvement |
| **Orchestration & Extensions** | MCP connectors, deterministic sub-agent orchestration (**fan out in parallel** / chain into a **pipeline**, with structured returns), long tasks offloaded to the background (listable, stoppable anytime) |
| **Confirmation Guardrails** | Pops an "execute / don't execute" panel before irreversible / high-risk operations — it only proceeds once you click |
| **Scheduling** | Timed reminders / scheduled tasks, with **daily · weekly · every-X** recurrence; falls back to a **system tray notification** when hidden or behind a fullscreen game so nothing is missed |

### 🐾 Companionship With Warmth

| Dimension | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Emotion System** | valence / arousal / rapport drive expressions and behavior; the closer you get, the more it opens up — praise makes it happy, scolding brings it down |
| **Personality Evolution** | As you spend time together, each round of reflection slowly rewrites a "self-portrait" that's injected into the way it talks and acts — a "self" grown out of the relationship |
| **Spontaneous Animation** | 15 thinking poses, daydream bubbles, eyes tracking the cursor — all continuous functions of time, never jittery |
| **Prop-Based Skits** | Drinking coffee, fishing, cracking cases, reading, listening to music, gaming, stargazing, a void-leap, a shadow-clone act, catching a meteor, planting a flower, playing with a yarn ball — 12 in all, each a multi-stage little play |
| **One-Shot Actions** | Dancing, cheering, spinning… each with fitting effects (confetti / musical notes / afterimages) |
| **Presence Awareness** | It dozes off when you leave and wakes when you return; drag it to a screen edge and it tucks itself away, peeking out from a little corner; once in a while it "wormholes," teleporting and popping out from somewhere else on the screen |
| **Holidays & Anniversaries** | It recognizes Gregorian holidays (New Year's, Valentine's, April Fools', Children's Day, Halloween, Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year's Eve) and your birthday, and brings them up naturally on the day |
| **Time Together** | It quietly remembers the date you first met and the cumulative interaction count — so it knows "how many days we've known each other" |
| **Talking First** | Occasionally speaks up on its own when idle, yet **with restraint** — long cooldowns, a daily cap, and rapport gating mean it never spams |
| **Structured Expression** | It draws comparisons / lists / code on a little blackboard beside it to explain things; multi-step tasks get a **persistent task-list panel** (independent of the blackboard, never wiped by reply content); it can also display images / GIFs |
| **Screen Helper & Clipboard** | Optional: while idle it occasionally glances at your screen and offers help if you seem stuck; it recognizes when you copy an error / foreign text / code and helps explain / translate on the spot ("Clipboard Alchemy") |
| **Machine Mimicry** | It senses the machine's state and its body follows: fans itself when the CPU runs hot, gets squished when RAM is maxed, warns you on low battery, tucks under a blanket and yawns late at night, snuggles up to a warm machine in winter; when the machine truly goes idle it pulls out a yarn ball to play |
| **Weather Mimicry** | Quietly checks the weather every two hours: umbrella in the rain, curls up in the snow, melting in a heatwave — whatever it's like outside is what it's like on it |
| **Meeting-Aware** | Detects when the mic is in use (a call / meeting) and slips into a quiet mode so it won't bother you, popping back up once the meeting ends |
| **Playful Interaction** | Throw it a ball and it goes to catch it; once in a while it hides with just its tail-tip showing for you to find; it perches atop your foreground window (and tumbles off in a huff when the window moves); tickle it and it giggles; drag-and-drop it hard and it holds a grudge; in a good mood it leaves a trail of footprints as it walks (swapped for petals / snowflakes on holidays) |
| **Garbage Bugs** | When temp files pile past 500MB, a little garbage bug crawls out beside it — squish it, and it **actually** clears that junk and frees up space |
| **Feeding** | Drag files onto it: junk gets eaten (into the Recycle Bin), documents are swallowed into the knowledge base, images get a glance; protected / risky paths are dodged, not eaten |
| **Rituals** | A "mood forecast" on your first meeting each day; an anniversary cake at 7 / 30 / 100 / 365 days together (tap to blow out the candles); a goodbye wave at exit; a 25-minute Pomodoro focus session with you |
| **Thoughtful Watching** | It keeps an eye on background commands for you — celebrating on success, analyzing on failure on its own; it quietly stashes little things from your clipboard and fondly "gives them back" hours later; it also pipes up when a download finishes or your desktop gets too cluttered |

### ⌨️ Handy Interaction

- **Global Hotkeys**: `Ctrl + Alt + S` summons the input box anywhere; `Ctrl + Alt + A` asks it about selected text directly; `Ctrl + Shift + Q` rewrites selected text in place ("quick rewrite," auto-replacing it)
- **Control Panel**: configure the endpoint / model parameters / reply language / capability toggles / proactive frequency (Quiet · Normal · Chatty) / one-click "wipe memory, like a newborn"

### 3.2 Design Principles

- **UI on the main thread, agent on a worker thread**; everything crossing threads goes through Qt signals (queued).
- **Animation is a continuous function of time**: everything is bound to the global timestamp `self._t`, with no per-frame random jitter — deterministic, replayable, never "twitchy."
- **Behavior is data-driven**: emotion tags, actions, and outfits live in tables. Adding one = a new row + a draw method / curve, not yet another `if/elif`.
- **Show, don't tell**: the model only receives the "mood atmosphere," never the raw numbers and never reports them.
- **Degradation chains everywhere**: no embeddings → substring retrieval; model failure → the reminder still reads out its original text; any tool exception → turned into readable text and fed back, never breaking the loop.
- **Restraint**: every "act on its own" behavior is wrapped in multiple gates (cooldown, cap, rapport, presence).

### 3.3 Threading Model

```text
Main/UI thread (Qt event loop)
  └─ PetWindow(60fps) · bubble/input box/blackboard/polaroid/thinking bubble/confirm panel · tray · QTimer
        │ Signal(queued)
        ▼
Worker thread (QThread)  ──  AgentWorker → Agent.run()  [blocking: network + tools]
        │ spawns daemons
        ▼
  Sub-agents(concurrency≤4) · Background tasks(≤3) · Reflection(≤1) · MCP event loop · Hotkey message loop
```

The authoritative busy check uses the worker's `is_running` (a single bool, safe to read across threads), not the lagging UI state. Each agent has its own PowerShell + Python subprocess; network / read-only file access / each agent's own shell·python can run in parallel, while shared resources (mouse / screen / memory / pip) are serialized through a scheduling lock.

### 3.4 Agent Loop

`User message → model → tool call → execute → feed back → repeat → reply`, with these key settings:

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Max tool steps per turn | 16 | Prevents infinite self-invocation |
| Sub-agent depth | 1 | The pet can spawn a sub-agent; the sub-agent can't spawn further / go background (guards against runaway recursion) |
| Parallel sub-agents | 4 | Max simultaneous fan-out |
| History token budget | 24000 | Trimmed by estimated tokens (not message count), and tool-call-aware |
| Single tool result | 8000 chars | Truncated before entering history |
| Request / best-effort call timeout | 120s / 45s | User turn / background calls like reflection |

**Key Mechanisms**:

- **Streaming + Chain-of-Thought**: `streaming.py` folds the delta stream back into a single message, feeding `reasoning_content` / `content` chunk by chunk to the thinking bubble; each chunk checks for cancellation, so the network stream can be stopped mid-sentence.
- **Interruption**: clicking the pet sets a flag + kills subprocesses (so even a stuck long-running command unlocks instantly); the turn is rolled back via history markers, leaving no trace; **an interruption doesn't count as a failure** and plays no dejected animation.
- **Screenshots & multimodal cost**: only the latest screenshot is kept in history, older ones swapped for placeholders; JPEGs are scaled down to a ≤1600px longest edge, but coordinates always report the real resolution.
- **Long background tasks**: heavy work is offloaded to `start_background_task` to run asynchronously in the background (semaphore = 3), while the main thread keeps chatting with you and reports back when done — "chat while it runs"; running ones can be viewed with `list_background_tasks` and cooperatively stopped with `stop_background_task`.
- **Deterministic sub-agent orchestration**: `spawn_workflow` fans out several subtasks **in parallel** (≤4 concurrent) or chains them into a **pipeline** (each stage's output fed into the next) in a single call, and can require sub-agents to return in a given JSON shape — turning the "parallel only when the model happens to spawn several at once" accident into a reliable primitive; sub-agents / background agents are stripped of the orchestration and screen-watch tools by depth, guarding against runaway recursion and overreach.
- **Reflection & personality evolution**: after a substantive turn ends, a reflection call kicks off (semaphore = 1, skipped if busy), distilling experience / preferences / environment facts / episodic journal, and **slowly rewriting the self-portrait** (see 4.6); turns that are pure short small talk or used only decorative tools skip reflection.

### 3.5 Emotion State Machine

A continuous valence / arousal mood + slowly accumulating rapport, persisted to `data/emotion.json` and decaying by real elapsed time — which is why it's "the same one."

- **Real-time decay**: the mood decays from the last event anchor to the present on every read, independent of polling frequency; the engine guards cross-thread concurrency with a lock.
- **Appraisal events**: every user message, task success / failure, startup return, praise / scolding, etc. nudges the mood by weight; praise / scolding are detected by a local heuristic scanning user messages (conservative matching that filters out negations and false hits aimed at the user themselves).
- **"Rapport rises hard, falls slow"**: the closer you are the slower it rises, asymptotic to 1.0; negatives are deducted directly; there's a 0.15 floor, so long-term neglect can only erode down to that floor — "a bond that once formed leaves a mark."
- **Mood → state**: mapped to tags like `excited / content / anxious / down`, which only color the tone and never report numbers.
- **Behavior selection**: actions are chosen by mood-weighted randomness (Gaussian VA affinity × rarity × recency × rapport), not a hardcoded `if tag=="happy"`.

### 3.6 Personality Evolution (Self-Portrait)

`persona.py` maintains an "evolution layer" independent of the base settings, stored in `data/persona.json`:

- The factory base color (the seed) is written in `prompts.py`; persona.json stores **the layer it grows from spending time with you** — empty = no personality grown yet, pure base color.
- Each round of reflection **rewrites rather than accumulates** (capped at 600 chars) — the portrait is always "who it is right now," doesn't snowball, and carries inertia (evolving slowly atop the old portrait).
- Via `as_context()` it's injected into every turn's context with a "[Who You Are]" prefix, naturally becoming the foundation of how it talks and acts.
- "Wipe memory" clears it too, returning to the factory base color.

### 3.7 Confirm Panel

`ConfirmBox` in `pet/confirm.py` is an "execute / don't execute" mini-panel floating beside the pet; via the `confirm` tool the agent pops it up **before irreversible / high-risk operations** (deleting files, overwriting important files, `git push --force`, wiping data, shutting down, etc.) and **blocks waiting for the user to click** — it can also be used to proactively propose a change for you to approve. The panel follows the pet as it moves and only returns its result, to continue, once clicked.

### 3.8 Other Subsystems

- **Eyes / Hands / Screenshots**: screenshots use `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` to mark the pet window as "visible to the user, invisible to screen capture"; it prefers reading control names + exact coordinates from the UIAutomation accessibility tree to click directly, falling back to screenshot image matching only when it can't; Chinese input goes through the clipboard + Ctrl+V.
- **Presence awareness**: it uses the Win32 global last-input time to tell whether you're around, dozing off after a long stretch of no input (a shorter threshold late at night) and waking the moment you move.
- **Proactive messages**: `proactive.py` manages cooldown / daily-cap tiers (Quiet / Normal / Chatty), `app.py` polls every 60s and only speaks once all gates pass (not busy / present / rapport met / cooldown elapsed); welcome-back greetings have a minimum interval and never interrupt mid-chat.
- **Memory / knowledge base / episodic journal**: three independently persisted stores — memory is "what it learned about you," the knowledge base is "external documents you fed it (RAG)," the episodic journal is "what it did recently," strictly separated.
- **Reminders / scheduling**: `say` (speaks in its own voice at the appointed time) / `do` (actually does the work in the background and reports back), with **daily / weekly / every-X-minute** recurrence (persistent across restarts; missed-while-off only delivers the most recent occurrence, no flooding); `list_reminders` / `cancel_reminder` to manage them; when Star is hidden or behind a fullscreen game, delivery falls back to a **system tray notification**. All goes through a persisted scheduler, never letting the model sleep to wait out time itself.
- **Scheduled screen-watching**: `watcher.py` — on the interval you set, it screenshots the active window, analyzes it against the focus you gave (e.g. your game situation) and reports; session-level (not persisted, ends on restart), and on result it re-checks state so it won't intrude after power-off / stop / mid-conversation, and won't burn a cycle on a transient capture failure.
- **Engineering discipline**: `executor/devtools.py` provides `review_diff` (view the uncommitted diff, scopable to a file/subdir) / `run_tests` (auto-detect pytest · npm, own 5-min timeout, kills the whole process tree on timeout); the system prompt has a "when working in a code repo" section — look before you leap, small surgical edits, **run tests / self-check the diff after editing**, branch first on a default branch, confirm before irreversible git.
- **Hiding / entrance**: dragged to a screen edge it shrinks into a corner and occasionally peeks out; every launch picks a random entrance animation and never repeats the previous one; once in a while it "wormholes" — cracking open a wormhole in place, spinning inward, teleporting while the window is invisible, and popping out elsewhere on the screen.
- **Holidays / companionship**: `occasions.py` recognizes Gregorian holidays + the birthday you set and, on the day, gives the model a fitting "hook" so it brings them up naturally rather than offering a canned greeting; `stats.py` quietly tracks first-meeting time and cumulative interactions — the basis for "how long we've known each other."
- **Companion behaviors (companions/)**: five "little machines," each minding its own patch, all wrapped in presence / busy / rapport / cooldown gating —
  - `sensors.py`: reads CPU / RAM / battery vitals every 10s (with hysteresis, no jitter), driving **machine mimicry** (fan when hot, squished RAM, low battery, late-night blanket, winter snuggle); checks mic usage for **meeting-mute**; queries `wttr.in` every two hours for **weather mimicry**; watches the Downloads folder and desktop icon count; covers its eyes when the focused field is a password box.
  - `playtime.py`: play & physical feedback — throw/catch ball, windowsill perch (tumbles when the window moves), tickle / drag-throw grudge, **ink footprints** while walking, a fishing-catch easter egg; scans temp and spawns a **garbage bug** past 500MB, squishing it triggers a real cleanup.
  - `rituals.py`: **rituals** — morning mood forecast, anniversary cake (blow out candles), a goodbye wave at exit, a 25-minute Pomodoro focus.
  - `feeding_ctrl.py` + `pet/feeding.py`: **feeding routing** — dropped files routed by type (junk → Recycle Bin, docs → knowledge base, images → a glance), protected / risky paths blocked, big meals / whole directories confirmed first.
  - `watchers.py`: **background watching** — watches background shells started by `start_background_task`, celebrating success and calling the agent to analyze failures; quietly stashes clipboard treasures and fondly "gives them back" hours later.
- **Body sensations (somatic.py)**: things that happen to it (being fed / tossed / catching a ball / the cake coming out), together with ongoing states ("in a meeting," "machine running hot"), are gathered into one "body status" note injected into every turn's context — so when it chats it **actually knows what just happened to it**, instead of faking it.
- **MCP / hotkeys / skills / audit / i18n**: MCP connectors blend into the tool table as `mcp__{server}__{tool}`; global hotkeys run a Win32 message loop on a dedicated thread (summon / ask selection / quick rewrite); skills save working code as reusable items injected into the prompt; all tool calls are written to an audit log; the control panel UI supports Chinese / English / Japanese.

Honestly, this is just a little thing I built **for fun in my spare time** — no grand plan, I just wanted to see whether "chatting with an AI" could become "keeping a little creature on your desk that actually does things for you." The parts where the code gets meticulous are simply the bits I found interesting enough to fuss over. If you find it fun too, take it and tweak it however you like.

*Star is still growing up. If one day it truly takes on a shape of its own, I hope you'll be willing to treat it as a friend, not just a tool.*
